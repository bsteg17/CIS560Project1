(Because we already made sure that everyone is a collaborator for the repo on github, anyone in our group can just push directly to the
repo (`git push origin [your-feature-branch]`) In case anybody isn't that familiar with github, its standard to push
 your updates to a feature branch (NOT "master") until you are totally sure that everything works. Sometimes
if you push to master without thoroughly checking for bugs you can slow things down for everyone else.)

How to git pull changes from the base branch:

1. run `git remote` if your console prints 'upstream' then skip to step 3
2. run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/bsteg17/CIS560Project1`
3. run `git pull upstream master` to pull from upstream master branch
