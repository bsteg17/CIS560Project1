WINDOWS
-------
windows isn't typically considered an acceptable rails dev environment, but if you have no other option then you can try these instructions:

MAC
-------
https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan

once you have rails properly installed just `cd` into the front_end directory and enter the command `rails s`

if the server boots properly then you can visit the site by going to `localhost:3000` in your browser
