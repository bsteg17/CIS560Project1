We will store information about pokemon. Pokemon will have combat points
health points, name, and a link to an image of it. The name will uniquely
identify the pokemon and be the key.

Trainers are people who are identified by their name which is unique.
Some are a part of a team. Many trainers can have many pokemon and a trainer
can have multiple of the same pokemon.

by its name and has its own color.

item, a combat item, or a pokeball.
